Introduction of the problem: 
What is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.

Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 740 180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under five years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but deaths are highest in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (World Health Organisation, 2021).

The Importance of Diagnosing Pneumonia?
The risk of pneumonia is immense for many, especially in developing nations where billions face energy poverty and rely on polluting forms of energy. Over 150 million people get infected with pneumonia on an annual basis especially children under 5 years old. In such regions, the problem can be further aggravated due to the dearth of medical resources and personnel. For example, in Africa’s 57 nations, a gap of 2.3 million doctors and nurses exists. For these populations, accurate and fast diagnosis means everything. It can guarantee timely access to treatment and save much needed time and money for those already experiencing poverty (Stephen, Sain, Maduh, & Jeong, 2019).

The Data: X-Ray Images
A total of 5,856 X-ray images of anterior-posterior chests were carefully chosen from retrospective pediatric patients between 1 and 5 years old. The dataset contains two kinds of chest X-ray Images: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA, which are stored in three folders. In the PNEUMONIA folder, two types of specifc PNEUMONIA can be recognized by the fle name: BACTERIA and VIRUS.
